# Quality Control and Doublet Detection for Single-Cell Data

This project provides a Snakemake workflow for performing quality control including filtering low quality cells, correction of ambient RNA, and doublet detection on single-cell RNA sequencing data. The workflow utilizes Python, R, and several bioinformatics tools to preprocess and clean single-cell data, leveraging [SoupX](https://github.com/constantAmateur/SoupX) and [scDblFinder](https://github.com/plger/scDblFinder) for contamination correction and doublet detection.

## Requirements

### Software

- **Python** (version 3.8+)
- **Snakemake** (version 6+)
- **R** (version 4.0+)

### Python Packages
- `scanpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `anndata2ri`
- `rpy2`
- `python-igraph`
- `leidenalg`

You can install these packages with:
```bash
pip install scanpy seaborn matplotlib scipy anndata2ri rpy2 python-igraph leidenalg


### Adding Package Installation to Snakemake Workflow

If you want to ensure that these packages are installed within the Snakemake workflow, you can add a `conda` environment configuration file to install dependencies automatically. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Create a Conda environment file (e.g., `environment.yaml`)**:

    ```yaml
    name: scRNAseq_qc
    channels:
      - conda-forge
      - bioconda
      - defaults
    dependencies:
      - python=3.8
      - scanpy
      - seaborn
      - matplotlib
      - scipy
      - anndata2ri
      - rpy2
      - python-igraph
      - leidenalg
      - r-base
      - bioconductor-scater
      - bioconductor-scdbfinder
      - bioconductor-soupx
    ```

2. **Activate the Conda environment in Snakemake** by adding this line to your `Snakefile`:

    ```python
    # At the top of your Snakefile
    conda: "environment.yaml"
    ```

This ensures that the environment is set up automatically with all required packages when running the Snakemake workflow.

## Usage

git clone https://github.com/moondancerrr/SingleCell-Pipeline.git
cd SingleCell-Pipeline
snakemake --cores <number_of_cores>

## Output
The workflow generates:

s4d8_quality_control.h5ad: Processed AnnData file with quality control and doublet detection results.
figures/: Directory containing .png files illustrating quality control metrics before and after filtering.
